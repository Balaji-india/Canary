# Canary progress log

Claude updates this at the end of every mission. If a mission stops early, write "stopped at: …" under it.

## Missions
**M1 Foundations**
- [x] 1.1 Setup and doctor
  - `python -m canary.cli doctor`: Doctor: all OK (Python 3.12.10 in venv, 11 packages, 3 role models, 9 datasets).
  - `pytest -q`: 15 passed. All 3 role models answered a real test prompt, fully on the GPU.
- [x] 1.2 Template, codegen, sandbox
  - `run-config baseline.yaml`: ok, valid results.json (control f1 0.9551, treatment f1 0.9447, 5 seeds). `run-config broken.yaml`: crash recorded (exit code 1, InvalidParameterError).
  - `pytest -q`: 64 passed. One-off smoke test: 19 of 19 runs ok across all 9 datasets, 7 models and 4 metrics.
- [x] 1.3 LLM wrapper (roles, JSON, cache, model queue)
  - `llm-smoke`: all OK. Valid JSON live from `qwen3:4b` (8.3 s), `gemma3:4b` (29.1 s) and `phi4-mini` (9.1 s), then all 3 repeats from the cache (0.0 s).
  - `pytest -q`: 118 passed. One-off real-sized review prompt (1324-1604 tokens): valid JSON and 100% GPU on all 3 models.
- [x] 1.4 Scientist, pre-registration, verdict, hash-chained ledger
  - `science --hypotheses 2`: 2 locked, run and verdicted (both inconclusive). `ledger verify`: OK (9 entries, including 3 from an earlier run that crashed).
  - After a manual verdict edit on a copy: `[FAIL] entry 3: content does not match its hash`, exit 1; real ledger still OK. `pytest -q`: 181 passed.

## Running or interrupted campaigns

## Decisions
- **Ollama only for now, no API keys.** A cloud model is added later with `/api`. Mission 1.3 must build `llm.py`
  so that switching to an API needs only a config change (`provider` in `config/models.yaml`, key in `.env`), with
  no changes to the code that calls it. Whatever is chosen, the Skeptic stays a different family from the Scientist.
- **Python 3.12.10** installed per user with winget, first on the user PATH. Python 3.11.9 stays installed but is
  unused. The project runs from `.venv`; `requirements.lock` records the exact tested versions.
- **Skeptic A runs on the fallback `gemma3:4b`.** `gemma4:e4b` is a 6.13 GB download and will not fit in 6 GB VRAM.
  Do not pull it on this machine: `resolve_roles` prefers it as soon as it is installed.
- **Scientist runs on the fallback `qwen3:4b`** (already installed). `qwen3.5:4b` is optional, and pulling it
  switches the Scientist automatically. Skeptic B is `phi4-mini`.
- **Ollama upgraded from 0.20.2 to 0.40.13**, because the registry refused `gemma3:4b` on the old version (HTTP 412).
- **Datasets are cached as `data/cache/<name>.csv.gz`**, with the label in `__target__`, so they load offline.
- **Run folders stand alone.** Each `data/runs/<uuid>/` holds its script, config and a dataset copy; the script never
  imports `canary`, so an experiment has no route to the sealed table in the normal code path.
- **Hyperparameters are checked by scikit-learn, not by `validate_config`.** A bad value is a recorded crash. Structural
  errors (unknown dataset, model or metric) are `invalid_config`, and they stay out of the crash rate because no code ran.
- **Template choices:** the minority class is the positive class for f1 and roc_auc; multiclass f1 is macro; roc_auc is
  allowed on two-class datasets only; numeric columns are always median-imputed and text columns always imputed and
  one-hot encoded, fitted on train only; both arms share each seed's split.
- **The optional code slot from DESIGN section 3 is not built.** Nothing needs it yet; add it if the Scientist does.
- **The LLM cache key is wider than CLAUDE.md's hash(model + prompt):** it also hashes the system prompt, schema and
  temperature, because the same prompt under another schema is a different question.
- **`parse_reply` is strict:** after removing `<think>` blocks and code fences, the reply must be exactly one JSON
  value. It never searches prose for JSON, because a reply with two candidate verdicts would make the verdict a guess.
- **Retries change the prompt** by adding the rejection reason, because at temperature 0 the same prompt repeats the
  same bad reply. The cache key still uses the original prompt.
- **Providers can be set per role** (`provider:` on a role in `models.yaml`), so a cloud Scientist can sit beside local
  Skeptics. Only Ollama exists today: `/api` adds a class to `PROVIDERS`, then only config and `.env` change. Reading
  the key from `.env` is not built yet.
- **Added to `models.yaml`:** `num_ctx: 8192`, `num_predict: 1024`, and timeouts of 300 s (cold) and 120 s (warm).
- **Verdict rule (`prereg.compute_verdict`):** supported = mean effect >= `min_effect` and CI above 0; not supported =
  whole CI below `min_effect`; otherwise inconclusive. A failed run is inconclusive, with the reason stored.
- **The verdict CI uses the Nadeau-Bengio correction** (variance factor 1/n + n_test/n_train), because random splits of
  one dataset overlap and a plain t interval would be too narrow. `docs/DESIGN.md` did not specify a test.
- **Code, not the LLM, sets seeds, split and alpha.** New `science:` block in `campaign.yaml`, with `min_effect_floor:
  0.005` so trivially small effects cannot count as success. `direction` is "increase" or "decrease"; `confidence` means
  P(result reaches `min_effect` in that direction).
- **The Scientist's schema has one form per model (`anyOf`)**, using `codegen.MODEL_PARAMS`. Hand-written configs may
  still use any parameter. Tried and rejected on real replies: an open `params` object (garbled keys, repeat-loops,
  1 real crash) and one shared parameter list (mixed parameters between models). The final form gave 8 of 8 acceptable.
- **Each LLM retry uses a new seed**, because a sampling failure repeats at the same seed. Scientist retries put the
  attempt number in the prompt, because a repeated prompt would only replay the cached rejected reply.
- **Rejected proposals are printed, not stored in the ledger:** nothing was locked or run for them.
- **The ledger shares `data/canary.db` with the LLM cache.** Append-only is enforced by the API and detected by the
  chain; there is no database trigger, so a manual edit is possible and shows up in `ledger verify`.
- **The ledger keeps the real crashed run** (hypothesis `6352b91a`, entries 1-3) as a true record.

## Fixes
- `qwen3:4b` crashes and "token repeat limit" aborts from the open `params` schema: fixed with one schema form per model.
- A retried proposal replayed the cached rejected reply: each retry prompt now carries its attempt number.
- OpenML download crash on non-text labels (sklearn's pandas parser under pandas 3): now uses `parser="liac-arff"`.

## Known issues
- **5 seeds may be too few for decisive verdicts.** Both real runs were inconclusive, with CI widths of about 0.10 and
  0.16 against a `min_effect` of 0.005. That is honest, but if most verdicts stay inconclusive the ledger will have
  little to accept. Check this on more runs (Mission 4.4) before changing `seeds_per_arm`.
- **The Scientist barely varies.** 8 trial proposals were nearly identical (same dataset and model family, confidence
  0.75 each), and both real hypotheses used the same dataset. A constant confidence will limit what the Brier score
  shows (Mission 3.2). The graveyard and calibration feedback may help; if not, ask for dataset variety in the prompt.
- **`qwen3:4b` hypotheses contain errors in their wording,** such as "76/2:24", and claim reasons that may not hold.
  Verdicts are unaffected, because they use only the configs and results.
- **The ledger cannot detect removal of its newest entries,** or a full rewrite of the chain from an edited point. A
  test documents this. Fixing it needs the latest hash stored elsewhere, for example in git.
- **`ledger verify` reports a problem if a run folder is deleted.** `/clean` must never remove `data/runs/` folders
  that the ledger references.
- **`crash_rate()` counts every folder in `data/runs/`, including the deliberate `broken.yaml` run** (it shows 1 of 2
  now). Before reporting a crash rate against the 42% figure, count campaign runs only.
- **The sandbox guards against accidents, not attacks:** experiments can still reach the network and other files. This
  is acceptable while scripts come only from our template; revisit it before running LLM-written code (Mission 6.2).
- **The cache can hide reviewer drift.** The key uses the model tag, not its digest, so if a tag is re-pulled with new
  weights, old replies are still served. Mission 4.3 should add the digest or bypass the cache when measuring drift.
- **Prompts longer than `num_ctx` are still cut silently by Ollama.** A real script uses about 1600 of 8192 tokens,
  so this is safe today. Mission 1.5 should check `prompt_eval_count` or the prompt size if prompts grow a lot.
- **Cold model loads are slow** (27-110 s seen). Handled with the 300 s cold timeout and `ModelQueue`.
- **`qwen3:4b` writing reasoning into replies did not occur in schema mode:** 2 of 2 real replies were clean JSON. Plain
  text mode was not retested, and any remaining `<think>` block is stripped.
- The Ollama CLI prints `CHECK failed: mlx_compile_cache_new_` on `--version` and `list`. The commands still worked
  and the cause is unknown.
- OpenML returns temporary 503 and "not found" errors. If a download fails, re-run `cache-datasets`; it skips what is
  already cached.
- `python3` still opens the Windows Store stub. Canary only uses `python`, so this is harmless.

## Next 3 actions
1. Run `/explain canary/prereg.py` for viva prep (the verdict rule and the Nadeau-Bengio correction).
2. Run `/mission 1.5` (blinding and Skeptic). The crashed run has no results, so decide how it is audited.
3. Run `/mission 2.1` (Saboteur: 10 bug classes × 2 tiers).
